Documenting my beginner journey in genomics and bioinformatics using Galaxy, starting with core tutorials and workflows.
# ðŸŒŒ Welcome to My Galaxy Genomics Learning Repository

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sanskriti Sahoo, and this repository documents my learning journey through the **Galaxy Training Networkâ€™s** [Learning Pathways]
(https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/learning-pathways/) pathway.

I've begun by completing the following foundational tutorials:

- âœ… **A short introduction to Galaxy**: Learned how to navigate Galaxy, import datasets, run simple tools, and examine outputs.
- âœ… **Galaxy Basics for Genomics**: Practiced working with FASTQ files, quality control using FastQC, and built my first simple workflow.

This repository will grow as I progress through more topics like:
- RNA-seq analysis and differential expression
- Quality control and visualization using MultiQC
- Variant calling, genome annotation, and beyond

Iâ€™m building this as a reproducible portfolio to strengthen my foundations in **genomics**, **computational biology**, and **bioinformatics**. Whether youâ€™re a fellow student, a mentor, or just curious â€” feel free to explore, reuse, or reach out!

Happy learning! âœ¨  
â€” Sanskriti
