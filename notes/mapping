🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Fourth Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: Mapping RNA-seq Reads to a Reference Genome

🔧 Key Tools Used:

Tool	| Purpose
SAMtools | sort	Sort BAM files by genomic coordinates for efficient access
Bowtie2 |	Map sequencing reads to the reference genome (Mouse mm10)
IGV	| Visualize mapped reads (optional, local tool)

These tools are fundamental for aligning short reads and preparing them for downstream analysis like variant calling or gene expression quantification.

🗃️ Data Used:
Species: Mus musculus (Mouse)

Genome: mm10 (pre-indexed in Galaxy for Bowtie2)

Input: Paired-end FASTQ files

Files:
wt_H3K4me3_read1.fastq.gz
wt_H3K4me3_read2.fastq.gz

📌 Goals:
-> Learn to map the reads of an experiment to a reference genome 
-> Understand how to evaluate mapping results
-> Count the number of reads per gene 
-> Interpret gene expression results from aligned reads

🧠 What I Learned:

The importance of using the correct reference genome and index

How mapping quality scores indicate alignment confidence

How to interpret mapping statistics like alignment rate and read distribution

⚠️ Challenges I Faced:
I had some confusion choosing the correct mm10 genome index from the Galaxy history vs built-in reference.
Also, understanding paired-end read orientation and interpreting the output took some time.
Double-checking input file pairings and matching strand-specific options was key.

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub:
✅ Summary notes (this post!)
✅ Screenshot of dataset preview 
✅ Learning log entry

This tutorial deepened my understanding of how raw RNA-seq reads are aligned and quantified — foundational for any downstream transcriptomic analysis.

📣 Recommendation:
If you're new to RNA-seq analysis, this tutorial is a must-do after learning basic quality control. It connects sequencing data to gene-level expression profiles — a vital step in functional genomics!
