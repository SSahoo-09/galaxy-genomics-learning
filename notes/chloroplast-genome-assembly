🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Sixth Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: Chloroplast Genome Assembly

🔧 Key Tools Used:

Tool |	Purpose
Get Data  | Import raw FASTQ files for the from sweet potato sample, from the paper Zhou et al. 2018.
Bandage Image | Visulaize de novo assembly graphs
Bandage Info | determine statistics of de novo assembly graphs
Prokka | Prokaryotice genome annotation

🗃️ Data Used:
Sweet potato sample, from the paper Zhou et al. 2018.
Chloroplast-specific assembly 

📌 Goals:
Learn to isolate organelle genomes (chloroplast) from total genomic DNA reads
Perform quality trimming and genome assembly
Identify and extract chloroplast-specific sequences 
Visualize assembly graph to understand contig structure

🧠 What I Learned:
Quality control is essential to avoid assembling erroneous or fragmented contigs
Bandage helps interpret how different contigs are connected within the assembly graph

⚠️ Challenges I Faced:
Locating the correct FASTQ files and understanding data formats
Interpreting the output to confidently identify chloroplast sequences
Understanding the usage of Bandage
Identifying the best contig when multiple similar hits appeared

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub:
✅ Summary notes (this post!)
✅ Screenshot of Dataset Preview
✅ Learning log entry

This tutorial was an excellent introduction to working with organelle genomes and understanding how targeted assemblies differ from whole-genome projects. It also highlighted how public data can be used to reproduce research-like workflows.
