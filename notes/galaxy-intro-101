🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Second Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: Galaxy Basics for genomics

🔧 Key Tools Used: 
Tool | Purpose 
Upload Data |	Import datasets from Galaxy or external links
Cut Columns from a Table |	Keep only the needed fields from a dataset
Sort | Organize rows based on a particular column
Join Two Datasets |	Combine datasets by a shared field (like gene ID)
Group |	Count or summarize unique values in a column

These may not be genomics-specific tools but general-purpose data wrangling tools. 

🗃️ Data Used
The data used in the Galaxy Project's "Galaxy Basics for genomics" tutorial was on human chromosome 22. This was provided to get familiarized with the basics of the Galaxy platform.

Goals: The primary goal of this tutorial was to learn the fundamental operations within the Galaxy platform. This included:

-> Importing data into a Galaxy history.

-> Running various tools on that data.

-> Working with histories (managing and organizing analysis steps).

-> Creating and using workflows (automating sequences of tools).

-> Sharing work (histories and workflows) with others.

🧠 What I Learned
How to navigate the Galaxy interface (histories, tools, datasets)

Understanding how each tool execution creates a new dataset

Renaming, annotating, and organizing datasets for clarity

Exporting and sharing workflows for reproducibility

I also exported my own .ga workflow from this tutorial — a reusable pipeline I can run again or adapt later. (Check it out in my GitHub repo! 🔗)

⚠️ Challenges I Faced
The need to to intersect the file with the exon locations with the file containing the SNP locations and to sort the list of all exons, and find the number of SNPs they contain.
This helped in locating which exon had the highest number of SNPs. Working with the workflow editors to change parameters settings took some time to navigate however it was quite seemless and straightforward.

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub
✅ Find_exons_with_the_highest_number_of_features.ga (workflow file)

✅ Summary notes (this post!)

✅ Learning log entry

✅ Screenshot of dataset preview 

I’ll be documenting everything on GitHub and continuing to build a public learning portfolio as I go.

🧠 If you're just getting started with Galaxy or bioinformatics, I highly recommend this short but powerful tutorial. It’s the perfect first step into reproducible data science in the life sciences.
