🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Third Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: Quality Control

🔧 Key Tools Used: 
Tool | Purpose 
Upload Data |	Import raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files)
FastQC | Generate a quality report of sequencing reads
MultiQC | Summarize multiple QC reports into one file
FastQC (after trimming) | Re-run QC to check improvement

These may not be genomics-specific tools but general-purpose data wrangling tools. 

🗃️ Data Used:
The tutorial uses paired-end FASTQ files from Homo sapiens chromosome 22:
Sample: ERR458493
Data type: Paired-end RNA-seq reads
Size: Truncated to a small region for speed

Files:
ERR458493_1.fastq.gz (forward reads)
ERR458493_2.fastq.gz (reverse reads)

Goals: The objective was to

-> Understand the need for quality assessment in sequencing data

-> Use FastQC to analyze read quality

-> Trim poor-quality reads and adapter sequences 

-> Re-check quality post-trimming

-> Combine all QC reports using MultiQC

🧠 What I Learned:
How to interpret FastQC modules (per base quality, GC content, duplication levels)

Why adapter trimming and quality filtering are crucial for reliable downstream analysis

How to compare raw vs. cleaned reads

How MultiQC combines all FastQC results into one, user-friendly report

How to create a workflow in Galaxy that includes QC + trimming + summary


⚠️ Challenges I Faced
At first, interpreting FastQC reports felt overwhelming, understanding red/yellow/green flags took some review. It was tricky figuring out the correct parameters like leading/trailing quality cutoffs.
I had to re-run several steps to compare pre/post trimming results correctly. But once I got the hang of it, I really saw the advantages of QC pipelines.

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub

✅ Summary notes (this post!)

✅ Learning log entry

✅ Screenshot of dataset preview 

I’ll be documenting everything on GitHub and continuing to build a public learning portfolio as I go.

🧠 If you're just getting started with Galaxy or bioinformatics, I highly recommend this short but powerful tutorial. It’s the perfect first step into reproducible data science in the life sciences.
