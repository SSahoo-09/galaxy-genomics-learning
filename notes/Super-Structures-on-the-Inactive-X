üóÉÔ∏è **Data Used**  
The tutorial uses wild-type mouse ChIP-seq datasets from Wang et al. (2018), targeting histone marks and architectural proteins:

- **Histone Marks**: H3K27me3 (repressive), H3K4me3 (activating)  
- **Architectural Protein**: CTCF  
- **Control**: Input DNA (no immunoprecipitation)

Each target has two biological replicates:
- `wt_H3K4me3_rep1.fastq.gz`, `wt_H3K4me3_rep2.fastq.gz`  
- `wt_H3K27me3_rep1.fastq.gz`, `wt_H3K27me3_rep2.fastq.gz`  
- `wt_CTCF_rep1.fastq.gz`, `wt_CTCF_rep2.fastq.gz`  
- `wt_input_rep1.fastq.gz`, `wt_input_rep2.fastq.gz`
