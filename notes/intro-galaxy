🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My First Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: A Short Introduction to Galaxy
As I begin my journey into bioinformatics and computational biology, I wanted to build a strong foundation, and Galaxy tutorial gave me exactly that.

This “short introduction” isn’t about advanced sequencing or statistics. Instead, it helps to think like a data scientist inside Galaxy: importing data, running tools, examining outputs, and building reproducible workflows. Simple, but powerful.

🔧 Key Tools Used: 
Tool |	Purpose 
Upload Data |	Import datasets from Galaxy or external links
Cut Columns from a Table |	Keep only the needed fields from a dataset
Sort | Organize rows based on a particular column
Join Two Datasets |	Combine datasets by a shared field (like gene ID)
Group |	Count or summarize unique values in a column

These may not be genomics-specific tools but general-purpose data wrangling tools. 

🗃️ Data Used
The data used in the Galaxy Project's "Introduction to Galaxy" tutorial was a FASTQ file.

Goals: The Galaxy Project tutorial used DNA sequencing reads from a bacteria in FASTQ format as its data.

The main goal of this tutorial was to introduce the Galaxy user interface and the fundamental operations. It aimed:
-> How to get started in Galaxy.

-> How to upload files.

-> How to use various tools.

-> How to view results and manage histories.

-> How to extract and run a workflow.

-> How to share a history.

🧠 What I Learned
How to navigate the Galaxy interface (histories, tools, datasets)

Understanding how each tool execution creates a new dataset

Renaming, annotating, and organizing datasets for clarity

Exporting and sharing workflows for reproducibility

I also exported my own .ga workflow from this tutorial — a reusable pipeline I can run again or adapt later. (Check it out in my GitHub repo! 🔗)

⚠️ Challenges I Faced
At first, the history panel felt a bit overwhelming, it updates constantly with every step, but once I understood that each tool produces a new dataset, it clicked.

Figuring out how to rerun a tool with changed parameters took some trial and error.

I didn’t realize that dataset names matter when building workflows, naming them well really helps.

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub
✅ Galaxy-Workflow-QC_and_filtering.ga (workflow file)

✅ Summary notes (this post!)

✅ Learning log entry

✅ Screenshot of dataset preview

🚀 What’s Next?
Now that I’ve understood the Galaxy interface and the basics of workflow building, I’m moving on to tutorials that use real genomics data — starting with Galaxy Basics for Genomics (FastQC, Sort, mapping, and more).

I’ll be documenting everything on GitHub and continuing to build a public learning portfolio as I go.

🧠 If you're just getting started with Galaxy or bioinformatics, I highly recommend this short but powerful tutorial. It’s the perfect first step into reproducible data science in the life sciences.
