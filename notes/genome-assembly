🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Fifth Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: General Introduction to Genome Assembly

🔧 Key Tools Used:
Tool |	Purpose
Velvet (velveth & velvetg) |	Perform de novo genome assembly using de Bruijn graphs
FastQC |	Assess quality of raw sequencing reads
MultiQC |	Combine QC reports for easier interpretation
Quast |	Evaluate quality of the assembled genome (e.g., N50, number of contigs)

🗃️ Data Used:
Species: Small genome (simulated)
A set of reads from an imaginary Staphylococcus aureus bacterium with a miniature genome (197,394 bp).
Read Type: Paired-end FASTQ files (interleaved)

📌 Goals:
-> Understand the concept of de novo assembly using short reads
-> Learn how k-mer size affects assembly quality
-> Generate and evaluate genome assemblies using Velvet
-> Interpret assembly statistics 

🧠 What I Learned:
How de novo assembly works when there's no reference genome available
The trade-offs involved in selecting different k-mer sizes
How to assess assembly success using metrics like total length, and number of contigs
The role of quality control before and after assembly

⚠️ Challenges I Faced:
Choosing the correct k-mer size required several trials and careful interpretation
Understanding interleaved read formats and preparing input for Velvet correctly
Interpreting output from QUAST and linking it back to assembly decisions
Tracking datasets in Galaxy history — naming and organizing helped a lot

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub:
✅ Summary notes (this post!)
✅ Screenshots of dataset preview
✅ Learning log entry with assembly parameters and observations

This tutorial gave me hands-on experience with one of the most fundamental problems in genomics: assembling a genome from scratch. It’s ideal for understanding the computational steps behind creating genome drafts from raw sequencing data.
