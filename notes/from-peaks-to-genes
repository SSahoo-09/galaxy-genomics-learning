🌌 Getting Started with Galaxy: My Fifth Tutorial in Genomics
🧬 Tutorial: From Peaks to Genes 

🔧 Key Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose | 
| Get Data | Import interval datasets from UCSC for gene mapping | 
| Replace Text | Modify chromosome names for compatibility (20 → chr20) | 
| Convert Genomic Intervals to BED | Format conversion for downstream analysis | 
| bedtools Intersect | Find overlapping peaks and genes | 
| Extract Workflow | Create a reproducible analysis pipeline | 

🗃️ Data Used
- Public ChIP-seq peak dataset
- UCSC known genes interval track (GRCh37/hg19)

📌 Goals
- Link ChIP-seq peaks to nearby genes
- Understand different strategies for peak-gene associations
- Explore summit-based refinement for greater mapping accuracy
- Learn how workflows support reproducible research

🧠 What I Learned
- Chromosome formatting (e.g. chrX vs X) matters for tool compatibility
- Naive overlap-based mapping may miss finer regulatory relationships
- Summit positions offer more biologically relevant gene associations
- Extracting workflows makes complex analyses repeatable and shareable

⚠️ Challenges I Faced
- Interpreting interval formats and BED specifications
- Adjusting attributes to avoid tool errors (like incorrect column naming)
- Creating consistent naming conventions across datasets
- Understanding the rationale behind summit-based mapping

📤 What I Uploaded to GitHub
✅ Summary notes (this post!)
✅ Workflow from Galaxy
✅ Screenshot of Dataset Preview
✅ Learning Log Entry 

This tutorial gave me a deeper appreciation for precision in genomic interval analysis. It revealed how small changes in method (like using summits) can shift biological interpretations. I now feel more confident building and debugging Galaxy workflows from scratch.
